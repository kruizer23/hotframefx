If you've used macOS or a modern Linux desktop environment such as Gnome or KDE, you might have grown accustomed to something called hot corners and hot edges. It's when you send your mouse cursor into a screen corner or edge and fancy stuff happens. Such as showing an overview of all currently opened applications or minimizing all application windows. It takes a bit of getting used to at first, but once you get the hang of it, you don't want to miss it anymore...until you come back to the Windows operating system. </p> <p>At this point in time, Windows 8, 10 and 11 do not offer a build in feature for hot corners and hot edges. Luckily, you can find third-party utilities that bring this functionality: Hot Corners WX and WinXCorners to name just a few. Both excellent tools if you just need hot corners. Unfortunately, these tools do not support hot edges. So I thought: What to do now? And the idea to develop my own little utility was born. The result: HotFrameFx. I figured that others might find such a tool handy as well, so I decided to make it open source and available for free. A brief overview of HotFrameFx's features:</p> <ul> <li>Supports configurable actions for both corners and edges on the primary monitor.</li> <li>You can configure a keystroke combination or the launch of an application as the action.</li> <li>Five different corner and edge sensitivity levels.</li> <li>Runs from the system tray to not unnecessarily clutter the task bar.</li> <li>Can be configured to automatically start with Windows.</li> <li>Open source and completely free.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Head over to the releases page and download the latest version. After extracting the downloaded zip-file, you'll end up with the installer's <code>.exe</code> file. Simply double-click this file from your Windows explorer to start the installation.
