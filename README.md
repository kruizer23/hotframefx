*HotFrameFx* is a system tray utility for configuring hot corner and edge actions. 

With the help of *HotFrameFx* you can optimize your workflow when it comes to application and window management on your desktop. You can configure actions for all corners and edges on your primary monitor. It takes a bit of getting used to at first, but once you get the hang of it, you don't want to miss it anymore. Give it a try and see if you like it.
